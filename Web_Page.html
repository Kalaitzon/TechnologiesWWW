                <p1>
                    Daniel Gerhard Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author best known for his thriller
                    novels,
                    including the Robert Langdon novels Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost
                    Symbol (2009),
                    Inferno (2013) and Origin (2017). His novels are treasure hunts that usually take place over a
                    period of 24 hours.
                    They feature recurring themes of cryptography, art, and conspiracy theories. His books have been
                    translated into 57 languages and
                    , as of 2012, have sold over 200 million copies. Three of them, Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci
                    Code, and Inferno,
                    have been adapted into films, while one of them, The Lost Symbol, was adapted into a television
                    show.
                    The Robert Langdon novels are deeply engaged with Christian themes and historical fiction,
                    and have generated controversy as a result. Brown states on his website that his books are not
                    anti-Christian
                    and he is on a "constant spiritual journey" himself. He claims that his book The Da Vinci Code
                    is simply
                    "an entertaining story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate" and suggests that the book
                    may be
                    used "as a positive catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith."

                <h1>~Early Life~</h1>
                <p2>
                    Daniel Gerhard Brown was born on June 22, 1964, in Exeter, New Hampshire. He has a younger
                    sister,
                    Valerie (born 1968) and brother, Gregory (born 1974). Brown attended Exeter's public schools
                    until the ninth grade.
                    He grew up on the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown, was a
                    teacher of mathematics
                    and wrote textbooks from 1968 until his retirement in 1997. His mother, Constance (née Gerhard),
                    trained as a church
                    organist and student of sacred music. Brown was raised an Episcopalian, and described his
                    religious evolution
                    in a 2009 interview: "I was raised Episcopalian, and I was very religious as a kid. Then, in
                    eighth or ninth grade,
                    I studied astronomy, cosmology, and the origins of the universe. I remember saying to a
                    minister, 'I don't get it.
                    I read a book that said there was an explosion known as the Big Bang, but here it says God
                    created heaven
                    and Earth and the animals in seven days. Which is right?' Unfortunately, the response I got was,
                    'Nice boys don't ask that question.' A light went off, and I said, 'The Bible doesn't make
                    sense.
                    Science makes much more sense to me.' And I just gravitated away from religion."
                    When asked in the same interview about his then-current religious views, Brown replied: "The
                    irony is that I've really
                    come full circle. The more science I studied, the more I saw that physics becomes metaphysics
                    and numbers become
                    imaginary numbers. The further you go into science, the mushier the ground gets. You start to
                    say,
                    'Oh, there is an order and a spiritual aspect to science."
                    Brown's interest in secrets and puzzles stems from their presence in his household as a child,
                    where codes and ciphers were the linchpin tying together the mathematics, music, and languages
                    in which his parents worked. The young Brown spent hours working out anagrams and crossword
                    puzzles,
                    and he and his siblings participated in elaborate treasure hunts devised by their father on
                    birthdays
                    and holidays. On Christmas, for example, Brown and his siblings did not find gifts under the
                    tree,
                    but followed a treasure map with codes and clues throughout their house and even around town to
                    find the gifts.
                    Brown's relationship with his father inspired that of Sophie Neveu and Jacques Saunière in The
                    Da Vinci Code,
                    and Chapter 23 of that novel was inspired by one of his childhood treasure hunts. After
                    graduating from Phillips
                    Exeter, Brown attended Amherst College, where he was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity.
                    He played squash, sang in the Amherst Glee Club, and was a writing student of visiting novelist
                    Alan Lelchuk.
                    Brown spent the 1985 school year abroad in Seville, Spain, where he was enrolled in an art
                    history course at the
                    University of Seville. Brown graduated from Amherst in 1986.

                <h1>~Career~</h1>
                <p3>
                    After graduating from Amherst, Brown dabbled with a musical career, creating effects with a
                    synthesizer,
                    and self-producing a children's cassette entitled SynthAnimals, which included a collection of
                    tracks such as
                    "Happy Frogs" and "Suzuki Elephants"; it sold a few hundred copies. The music has been compared
                    to Gary Glitter.
                    He then formed his own record company called Dalliance, and in 1990 self-published a CD entitled
                    Perspective, targeted
                    to the adult market, which also sold a few hundred copies. In 1991 he moved to Hollywood to
                    pursue a career as
                    singer-songwriter and pianist. To support himself, he taught classes at Beverly Hills
                    Preparatory School. He also
                    joined the National Academy of Songwriters and participated in many of its events. It was there
                    that he met his wife,
                    Blythe Newlon, who was the academy's Director of Artist Development. Though it was not
                    officially part of her job,
                    she took on the seemingly unusual task of helping to promote Brown's projects; she wrote press
                    releases,
                    set up promotional events, and put him in contact with people who could be helpful to his
                    career.
                    She and Brown also developed a personal relationship, though this was not known to all of their
                    associates until 1993,
                    when Brown moved back to New Hampshire, and it was learned that Newlon would accompany him. They
                    married in 1997,
                    at Pea Porridge Pond, near Conway, New Hampshire. In 1994 Brown released a CD titled Angels &
                    Demons.
                    Its artwork was the same ambigram by artist John Langdon which he later used for the novel
                    Angels & Demons.
                    The liner notes also again credited his wife for her involvement, thanking her "for being my
                    tireless cowriter,
                    coproducer, second engineer, significant other, and therapist". The CD included songs such as
                    "Here in These Fields"
                    and the religious ballad, "All I Believe". Brown and his wife, Blythe, moved to, Rye, New
                    Hampshire in 1993.
                    Brown became an English teacher at his alma mater Phillips Exeter, and gave Spanish classes to
                    6th, 7th,
                    and 8th graders at Lincoln Akerman School, a small school for 8th grade with about 250 students,
                    in Hampton Falls.
                    Brown has written a symphonic work titled Wild Symphony which is supplemented by a book of the
                    same name.
                    The book is illustrated by Hungarian artist Susan Batori which feature simple ambigrams for
                    children,
                    while the visuals trigger the corresponding music in an accompanying app. The music was recorded
                    by the Zagreb
                    Festival Orchestra and will receive its world concert premiere by the Portsmouth Symphony
                    Orchestra in 2020.
                    On March 30, 2022, it was announced that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Weed Road Pictures will turn
                    Wild Symphony into
                    an animated musical feature film in the vein of Walt Disney's Fantasia, with Brown writing the
                    screenplay and songs,
                    and Akiva Goldsman producing.
